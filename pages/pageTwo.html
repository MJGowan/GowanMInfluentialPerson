          <p>After our graduation from Lincoln High School, while I persued a career in coding, Alana went the path of teaching. She is now a full time student at the University of the Pacific. I watched her put everything she had into keeping her grades up. The sheer number of essays she wrote to get her many scholarships and grants, in order to afford such a fine education, is astonishing. She focused all of her energy into being the best she could be, and she succeeded, reaching her goal.</p>
          <p>Specifically, she's majoring in English and Education, hoping to be a high school English teacher. She's still in contact with our favorite former English teachers, who praise her as one of their favorite students. She also took journalism classes as an elective, becoming the Editor-in-Chief, a position she took very seriously. She used her photography skills to take pictures for their paper as well, making her one of (if not the) biggest contributer to our school paper.</p>
          <p>On top of balancing her classes, she finds time for hobbies like art and photography, planning out future DND campaigns for our friend group, coaching her younger brother and the other Lincoln wrestlers, and driving me everywhere I need to go. This doesn't even touch on all she does for those she cares about.</p>
          <p>I think she's going to be an amazing educator. She loves kids, and has the patience to spend time teaching her students properly. The moment she has a class, she'll be caring for them as well.</p>
