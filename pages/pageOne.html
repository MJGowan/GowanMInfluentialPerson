              <p>Alana is my girlfriend. We have been together for about 3 1/2 years, since our sophomore year of highschool. She has been my biggest supporter since day 1, encouraging me to do so many things I needed to do for myself. She has supported me throughout health issues, both mental and physical, since before we were officially together. Now that we live together, she helps take care of me in situations where I cannot care for myself. Alana means everything to me. I've already given her a promise ring, we're only waiting for her to finish college at the<span> University of the Pacific</span> to put a proper ring on it.</p>

              <p>We are complete opposites in most ways. She's always been a fan of exercising and works hard keeping in shape, whereas I have never bothered. I love cartoons and childish shows, she prefers horror and action films. She likes dogs, I always preferred cats. She's the English major, and I'm in STEM. However, I feel our differences balance us out. She keeps me organized, forcing me to clean up after myself, which is important for my mental health. I remind her when it's time to relax and take a breather. I can still help her when she can't think of a word, and she helps me with just about everything else.</p>

              As I've struggled with my health, she's always been there for me. When I couldn't walk after an 8 hour shift at my first job, she put a pillow under my knees, wrapped my legs in KT tape, smothered me in Biofreeze and Tiger balm, and brought me my switch so I could relax for the rest of the night. She brought me my meals, helped me out of bed when I needed it, and made me feel okay even when I was ashamed of being unable to handle my job. She makes me feel loved in a way I never could've imagined.
